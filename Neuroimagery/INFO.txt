It might help to try the experiment again for a few minutes just to remind you of what the stimuli and the tasks where like (e.g, you might just try the practice for the auditory and visual task and then end the experiment).Each csv file contains data from a SINGLE PARTICIPANT.In each file, each row shows data from a single trial, and each column different type of information, as follows: sound = what sound was played (the pitch of the sound that was played – it actually shows the sound filename, where silence.wav is no sound, in the visual task)grating_frequency = the frequency of the grating (i.e., how many alternations of black and white); stimulus_start = the interval between the start of fixation cross and the start of the stimuluscorrect_key = what was the correct key (‘l’ or ‘h’) in that trialresponse= whether the response was correct (=1) or incorrect (=0)key_pressed = what key was pressed on that trialRTs = the response time on that trialorder = that is an index of the specific trialcondition = whether the trial was bimodal (i.e., both sound and visual stimulus, = 1) or unimodal (only sound or visual stimulus, depending on the task, =0)The columns that you definitely need for your analyses are: response, RTs, condition.That is what you need to test whether there is a difference in performance (RTs or accuracy or both) between unimodal and bimodal trials. However, you might want to add further, post-hoc analyses. For example, whether that effect changes between visual task and auditory task, or other analyses.You will need to calculate first individual means and standard deviations for each participant. Then use those for your statistical analyses.The main purpose of the experiment is to compare the unimodal (visual or auditory) condition with the bimodal (audio-visual) condition.For your report you need to provide descriptive statistics and inferential statistic, which you will run in Python (including libraries such as numpy and scipy). You might also want to show a table and/or a figure.In the appendix of the report you need to show me that code that you have used for your statistics.............................................12 participants in totalGender = 4 male, 4 female, 4 not reportedAge mean = 22
